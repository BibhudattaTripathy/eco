Desert ecology is the study of interactions between both biotic and abiotic components of desert 
environments. A desert ecosystem is defined by interactions between organisms, the climate in which they live, 
and any other non-living influences on the habitat. Deserts are arid regions that are generally associated with 
warm temperatures; however, cold deserts also exist. Deserts can be found in every continent, with the largest 
deserts located in Antarctica, the Arctic, 
Northern Africa, and the Middle East.

Deserts experience a wide range of temperatures and weather conditions, and can be classified into four types: 
hot, semiarid, coastal, and cold. Hot deserts experience warm temperatures year round, and low annual 
precipitation. Low levels of humidity in hot deserts contribute to high daytime temperatures, and extensive 
night time heat loss. The average annual temperature in hot deserts is approximately 20 to 25 °C, however, 
extreme weather conditions can lead to temperatures ranging from -18 to 49 °C.

Rainfall generally occurs, followed by long periods of dryness. Semiarid deserts experience similar 
conditions to hot deserts, however, the maximum and minimum temperatures tend to be less extreme, and 
generally range from 10 to 38 °C. Coastal deserts are cooler than hot and semiarid deserts, with average 
summer temperatures ranging between 13 and 24 °C. They also feature higher total rainfall values. Cold deserts 
are similar in temperature to coastal deserts, however, they receive more annual precipitation in the form of 
snowfall.[1] Deserts are most notable for their dry climates; usually a result from their surrounding geography. For example, rain-blocking mountain ranges, and distance from oceans are two geographic features that contribute to desert aridity. Rain-blocking mountain ranges create Rain Shadows. As air rises and cools, its relative humidity increases and some or most moisture rains out, leaving little to no water vapor to form precipitation on the other side of the mountain range.

Deserts occupy one-fifth of the Earth's land surface and occur in two belts: between 15° and 35° latitude in 
both the southern and northern hemispheres.[2] These bands are associated with the high solar intensities that 
all areas in the tropics receive, and with the dry air brought down by the descending arms of both the Hadley 
and Ferell atmospheric circulation cells. Dry winds hold little moisture for these areas, and also tend to 
evaporate any water present.

Many desert ecosystems are limited by available water levels, rather than rates of radiation or temperature. 
Water flow in these ecosystems can be thought of as similar to energy flow; in fact, it is often useful to look 
at water and energy flow together when studying desert ecosystems and ecology.[3]

Water availability in deserts may also be hindered by loose sediments. Dust clouds commonly form in windy, 
arid climates. Scientists have previously theorised that desert dust clouds would enhance rainfall, however, 
some more recent studies have shown that precipitation is actually inhibited by this phenomenon by absorbing 
moisture from the atmosphere. This absorption of atmospheric moisture can result in a positive feedback loop, 
which leads to further desertification.[4]

Desert landscapes can contain a wide variety of geological features, such as oases, rock outcrops, dunes, 
and mountains.[5] Dunes are structures formed by wind moving sediments into mounds. Desert dunes are generally 
classified based on their orientation relative to wind directly. Possibly the most recognizable dune type are 
transverse dunes, characterized by crests transverse to the wind direction. Many dunes are considered to be 
active,
meaning that they can travel and change over time due to the influence of the wind. However, some dunes can 
be anchored in place by vegetation or topography, preventing their movement.[6] Some dunes may also be referred 
to as sticky. These types of dunes occur when individual grains of sand become cemented together. Sticky dunes 
tend to be more stable, and resistant to wind reworking than loose dunes.[7] Barchan, and Seif dunes are among 
the most common of desert dunes. Barchan dunes are formed as winds continuously blow in the same direction, and 
are characterized by a crescent-shape atop the dune. Seif dunes are long and narrow, featuring a sharp crest, 
and are more common in the Sahara Desert.[8]

Analysis of geological features in desert environments can reveal a lot about the geologic history of the area. 
Through observation and identification of rock deposits, geologists are able to interpret the order of events 
that occurred during desert formation. For example, research conducted on the surface geology of the Namib 
Desert allowed geologists to interpret ancient movements of the Kuiseb River based on rock ages and features 
identified in the area.[9]

Deserts support diverse communities of plant and animals that have evolved resistance, 
and circumventing methods of extreme temperatures and arid conditions. For example, desert grasslands are
more humid and slightly cooler than its surrounding ecosystems. Many animals obtain energy by eating the 
surrounding vegetation, however, desert plants are much more difficult for organisms to consume.[10] To avoid 
intense temperatures, the majority of small desert mammals are nocturnal, living in burrows to avoid the intense desert sun during the daytime. These burrows prevent overheating and dehydration as they maintain an optimal temperature for the mammal.[11] Desert ecology is characterized by dry, alkaline soils, low net production and opportunistic feeding patterns by herbivores and carnivores. Other organisms' survival tactics are physiologically based. Such tactics include the completion of life cycles ahead of anticipated drought seasons, and storing water with the help of specialized organs.[12]

Desert climates are particularly demanding on endothermic organisms. However, endothermic organisms 
have adapted mechanisms to aid in water retention in habitats such as desert ecosystems which are commonly 
affected by drought.[13] In environments where the external temperature is less than their body temperature, 
most endotherms are able to balance heat production and heat loss to maintain a comfortable temperature. 
However, in deserts where air and ground temperatures exceed body temperature, endotherms must be able to 
dissipate the large amounts of heat being absorbed in these environments. In order to cope with extreme 
conditions, desert endotherms have adapted through the means of avoidance, relaxation of homeostasis, and 
specializations. Nocturnal desert rodents, like the kangaroo rat, will spend the daytime in cool burrows deep 
underground, and emerge at night to seek food. Birds are much more mobile than ground-dwelling endotherms, and 
can therefore avoid heat-induced dehydration by flying between water sources. To prevent overheating, the body 
temperatures of many desert mammals have adapted to be much higher than non-desert mammals. Camels, for example, can maintain body temperatures that are about equal to typical desert air temperatures. This adaptations allows camels to retain large amounts of water for extended periods of time. Other examples of higher body temperature in desert mammals include the diurnal antelope ground squirrel, and the oryx. Certain desert endotherms have evolved very specific and unique characteristics to combat dehydration. Male sandgrouse have specialized belly feathers that are able to trap and carry water. This allows the sandgrouse to provide a source of hydration for their chicks, 
who do not yet have the ability to fly to water sources themselves.[14]
