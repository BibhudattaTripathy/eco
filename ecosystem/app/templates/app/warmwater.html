<h3>Significance of water temperature</h3>
Temperature exerts a major influence on biological activity and growth. Temperature governs the kinds of organisms that can live in rivers and lakes. Fish, insects, zooplankton, phytoplankton, and other aquatic species all have a preferred temperature range. As temperatures get too far above or below this preferred range, the number of individuals of the species decreases until finally there are none.

Temperature is also important because of its influence on water chemistry. The rate of chemical reactions generally increases at higher temperature. Water, particularly groundwater, with higher temperatures can dissolve more minerals from the surrounding rock and will therefore have a higher electrical conductivity. It is the opposite when considering a gas, such as oxygen, dissolved in the water. Think about how much "bubblier" a cold soda is compared to a warm one. The cold soda can keep more of the carbon dioxide bubbles dissolved in the liquid than the warm one can, which makes it seem fizzier when you drink it.

Warm stream water is can affect the aquatic life in the stream. Warm water holds less dissolved oxygen than cool water, and may not contain enough dissolved oxygen for the survival of different species of aquatic life. Some compounds are also more toxic to aquatic life at higher temperatures.

<h3>Impervious surfaces contribute hot water to streams</h3>
After a summer thunderstorm, steam rises from rainfall heated by the pavement.
A hot parking lot can cause heated runoff to enter streams.

You might not think that water temperature is considered an important water-quality measurement. After all, temperature is not a chemical and it doesn't have physical properties you can see. But, if you ask a fish if the temperature of the water it is living in is important, it would yell yes (if it could talk)! In natural environments, temperature is not too much of a concern for aquatic life, since the animals and plants in the water have evolved to best survive in that environment. It is when the temperature of a water body changes, either by a natural event or by a human-induced event, that the fish break out in a sweat and start to worry.

This picture shows a typical parking lot after a strong summer rainstorm. Parking lots and roads, which are examples of impervious surfaces, where water runs off into local streams instead of soaking into the ground, as in natural environments, act as "fast lanes" for rainfall to make its way into streams. Rain that falls on a parking lot that has been baking in the sun all day during summer gets super heated and then runs off into streams. This heated water can be a shock to the aquatic life in the stream and can, thus, harm the water quality of the stream.

<h3>Seasonal changes in lakes and reservoirs</h3>
Temperature is also important in lakes and reservoirs. It is related to the dissolved-oxygen concentration in water, which is very important to all aquatic life. Many lakes experience a "turning" of its water layers when the seasons change. In summer, the top of the lake becomes warmer than the lower layers. You've probably noticed this when swimming in a lake in summer - your shoulders feel like they're in a warm bath while your feet are chilled. Since warm water is less dense that colder water, it stays on top of the lake surface. But, in winter some lake surfaces can get very cold. When this happens, the surface water becomes more dense than the deeper water with a more constant year-round temperature (which is now warmer than the surface), and the lake "turns", when the colder surface water sinks to the lake bottom.

<h3>Temperature Effects of Dam Operations</h3>
I'm sure fish have been living in the McKenzie River in Oregon for many thousands of years—long before many people lived there and definitely before the Cougar Dam was built. For eons, fish adapted to live and reproduce in a river having certain environmental characteristics that would not change quickly. But, after the construction of Cougar Dam, one thing that did change for the fish was the water-temperature patterns below the dam at certain times of year. The McKenzie River supports the largest remaining wild population of Chinook salmon in the upper Willamette River basin, and the South Fork McKenzie River provides good spawning habitat. It was found that the altered temperature pattern downstream of Cougar Dam created problems with regard to the timing of migration, spawning, and egg hatching for the fish. (Source: Caissie, D., 2006, The thermal regime of rivers—A review: Freshwater Biology, v. 51, p. 1389-1406)

This detrimental environmental consequence was realized in the mid 2000s and to restore the suitability of this reach for salmon spawning, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers added a sliding gate assembly to the intake structure at Cougar Dam. Water temperature patterns below the dam have become more like natural patterns recently, with the result being a lot of smiling salmon. The chart below shows the differences in temperature patterns for sites above and below the dam before any adjustments were made to fix the situation.
